:sparkles: [**Welcome to Alliance for Visible Diversity in Science!**](http://a4vdis.weebly.com) :sparkles:

This GitHub Repo is our place to organize our website content and other parts of our projects that live online.

Our main point: We are working to add more people of color to our school. We will do this by talking to both our teachers and students to bring more 

## Our Mission
Our mission is to increase visible diversity within the graduate programs at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). We do this by encouraging the recruitment, hiring, retention and most importantly support of underrepresented minorities. Our efforts target all levels, including students, postdoctoral fellows, staff, and faculty. We hope that our efforts will promote an institution-wide effort to diversify the scientific community.

## OHSU Initiatives

### Program Liaisons

Volunteer members act as liaisons who sit on admissions boards for graduate programs. Their role is to encourage admissions committees to invite a diverse group of students for interviews.

### Welcome Table

When each graduate program holds its recruitment event, we set up an information table to inform potential recruits that AVDS exists. This can be a powerful message of inclusion and welcome to students from minority backgrounds.

### Administrative Involvement

Possibly our most important goal is to elicit the involvement of OHSU's administration in our efforts to improve visible diversity in science. At the end of the day, we are students and only have the power of students, which is sadly not very much. The people who can make the most change are the administors of OHSU Program Heads, Principle Investigators, Committee Heads, Contributors.

### Open Forum Meetings

Biannually, we host an open forum meeting. These meetings have three uses. First, they allow the steering committee to update current members on our progress. Second, for visibility and recruitment of new members. And third, as networking for current members. Many of our members are interested in diversity and need to make contacts with like-minded people, and these open forums are a great opportunity.

## Outreach

### Undergraduate Recruitment Events

One of the best ways to improve diversity in graduate programs is to reach out directly to undergraduates and inform them that your program exists!

### Local Community Building

### Undergrad Workshops
